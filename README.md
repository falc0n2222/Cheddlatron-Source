The Official Source Code for Cheddlatron Selfbot.

After much consideration, Wraith and I have decided to sunset the Cheddlatron project in its current form. This decision comes after a long and intense period of development, filled with both fun and its fair share of stress.

The primary reason for this shift is the increasing demands of our personal lives. Both Wraith and I have significant commitments to school and work, which have gradually diminished our capacity to dedicate the necessary time and energy to Cheddlatron. As a result, we've experienced a decline in motivation to drive the project forward as actively as we once did.

However, we believe Cheddlatron still holds potential and serves a valuable purpose. Rather than completely abandoning the project, we've decided to open it up to the community. This means making the source code freely available and inviting contributions from anyone who is interested in improving and expanding its functionality. We envision this as a collaborative effort, where users can submit pull requests, suggest changes, and contribute fixes based on their own needs and insights.

We believe open-sourcing Cheddlatron offers several key benefits:

**Easier Usability:** By making the code accessible, users can customize and adapt Cheddlatron to their specific requirements, making it more versatile and user-friendly.

**Increased Trust:** Transparency is paramount. Open-sourcing the project allows anyone to inspect the code, verify its integrity, and ensure it aligns with their security expectations.

**Shared Beliefs:** We firmly believe that software like Cheddlatron should be freely available and accessible to everyone. Open-sourcing aligns with our personal values and promotes a collaborative ecosystem.

We are excited to see what the community can bring to Cheddlatron and hope that this transition will breathe new life into the project, fostering innovation and expanding its capabilities in ways we couldn't have imagined.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To ensure transparency and manage expectations, we want to emphasize that Cheddlatron's source code is being provided "as-is." While we are excited to open it up to the community, Wraith and I will no longer be offering direct support for the project. We encourage users to explore, experiment, and learn from the code, but please understand that we won't be able to provide individual assistance or troubleshooting. If you're new to the software or encounter challenges, we recommend leveraging online resources, tutorials, and community forums to enhance your understanding and find solutions. Consider it an opportunity to expand your skills and connect with other passionate developers!
